This is the backend of the application. The frontend can be found at https://github.com/mahlane-arbuus/Homework3

The backend should be launched with the command **nodemon server**  
The frontend should be launched with the command **npm run serve**

The application was developed using a Postgres database named 'testWad' (the same name as the database in the practicals), which can be accessed by the 'postgres'
user with the password 'delta'. It is run on localhost on port 5432, which is the default configuration. These settings are stored in database.js in Homework4, so they
can be changed there if need be.
